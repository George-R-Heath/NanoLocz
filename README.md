## About NanoLocz
*NanoLocz* is a free interactive AFM image viewer and analysis platform. It's designed for browsing and analysing
height data from AFM and HS-AFM imaging with the aim of increasing throughput.

**Capabilities:**
* Read AFM file types: .spm,  .asd,  .jpk,  .ibw,  .ARIS,  .tiff, .nhf, .gwy
* Image Levelling 
* Line Profiling  
* Video Alignment
* Simulation AFM
* Mask Analysis
* Particle Detection (height or reference based)
* Single Particle Tracking
* Particle Alignment
* *Localization AFM*
* Export as: .tiff, .gif, .avi, .png, .jpeg, .pdf, .txt, .csv, .xls

**Compatible file types:**  .spm,  .asd,  .jpk,  .ibw,  .ARIS,  .tiff, .nhf, .gwy.... more being added\
